## Bio
Broadly, my research interests lie in the social and cultural aspects of conservation, particularly the cognitions (e.g. attitudes, beliefs, values, etc.) and theories (e.g., cognitive hierarchy) underlying human-wildlife relations. My interest stems from my curiosity to understand why people have certain attitudes and beliefs towards conservation and how we can foster more favorable attitudes, beliefs and behaviors. I hope that by sharing my passion for conservation and animals, I will instill it in others as well.  

In my free time, I enjoy caring for my houseplants, hanging out with my dog and cat, crocheting, and listening to true crime podcasts. I am also obsessed with bats and it is my personal mission to get others to love them too. Check out this video I made about bats:
